# FOR LOOP IN PYTHON

# for i in range(0,51,2):
#     if (i == 50):
#         print(i)
#     else:
#         print(i, end = ", ")

# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Using a for loop print numbers from 0 to 100 separated by ","
# Using a for loop print numbers from 20 to 100 separated by ","
# Using a for loop print numbers from 10 to 100 separated by ","
# Using a for loop to print first 50 even numbers

# Using a for loop print all even numbers between 100 and 150 (inclusive)
# Using a for loop print all even numbers between 100 and 150 (exclusive)
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

# WHILE LOOP IN PYTHON

i = 0
while (i < 10):
    print("hi aized")
    i = i + 1
