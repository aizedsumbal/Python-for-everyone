# string manipulation using loops
#
name = "Ammar Saqib"
# print(name[len(name)-1])

# Write a piece of code that prints a string, character by character
#     e.g. for ammar it should print:
#     a
#     m
#     m
#     a
#     r


# using index
# for i in range(len(name)):
#     print(name[i])

# without using index
for i in name:
    print(i)

# if x = 1000 can you get its length using the len() function?
